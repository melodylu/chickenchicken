> This material was originally posted [here](http://www.quora.com/What-is-Amazons-approach-to-product-development-and-product-management). It is reproduced here for posterities sake.

There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.

  Jump To Do It Mat

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.

  Finally, anyone can keep their to do list in the cloud for maximum synergy out of the box thinking to make the world a better place socially.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.

  Jump To Do It Mat will revolutionize the way you keep tasks ordered by allowing access from any connected device.  By giving users the ability to add items and remove completed projects, focus is created to increase efficiency.  Let Jump To Do It Mat be your guide to fully realize your potential and remove barriers to success.

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.

  A common issue standing in the way of productivity is knowing where to start and how to delegate time.  Without a clear list that itemizes projects, users are paralyzed and unable to direct their energy effectively.  Further, traditional analog methods are not accessible freely, are wasteful, and likely to be lost.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.

  Jump To Do It Mat empowers users to create a collection of tasks at any time and from anywhere.  With everything centralized through a user friendly interface, users no longer have to worry about disparate information in dozens of locations.  By keeping everything in one place, goals can be quickly met.  Never again face uncertainty on where and how to spend the precious moments you have left in life!

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.

  "Jump To Do It Mat - A singular answer that increases your focus to collate and solve your many problems."

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.

  In less than fifteen seconds, a user can log into Jump To Do It Mat's website, create an account, and immediate begin adding to their list.  The interface is clean, minimal, and designed to decrease distraction.

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.

  "I frequently remember things I need to finish, but never have a universal way to write them down.  I used to have dozens of post it notes strewn about my desk and in my car.  With Jump To Do It Mat, I simply add a new task to my list through my phone, tablet, or PC, and always have access to it.  I save time, money, and can easily remind myself what needs to be done and in what order.  Now I never forget to pick up my children from the hospital!"

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.

# MVP (Solo) Project

### Overview:

You have 36 hours to produce something compelling using the skills you've honed over the past five weeks.

__Q:__ What are your inputs?
<br>
__A:__ 36 hours of (relatively) undivided attention

__Q:__ What is the required output?
<br>
__A:__ A compelling product presentation delivered to your classmates.


### Getting Started:

To build on your learning of core engineering concepts, we will begin thinking about how to actually manage projects. Engineering management is a deep skill and discipline with lots of history and academic writing. We will focus on just some highlights of content to give a very brief context of how we arrive here.

* Use an [Iterative and incremental development process](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_and_incremental_development) instead of a [Waterfall Process](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model)

<!--
*  [Agile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) - is a modern eveolution of Iterative and Incremental Development (IID) that further formalizes the IID philosophy with a set of principles and best practices. It also applies Lean Manufacturing process like [Kanban](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban).-->

<!--* [Lean Product Process](http://theleanstartup.com/principles) - Takes the essence of Agile Development methodology and applies it more broadly to the development of product and buiness models that support he requirements of the project.
-->


## Basic Requirements
- [] Fork the repo
- Complete the PRESS-RELEASE.md template (<30min)
  - [] Pick an idea (implement a technology, build a product, make art, etc).
  - [] Write it down on paper
  - [] Imagine what portion of this could be done in 24 hours.
  - [] Cut the scope in half.
  - [] Cut the above scope in half again.
  - [] Fill in the README.md template document
- [] Use iterative development (go straight to something that demos your idea)
- [] Prepare for pitch @ demo on Tuesday


## Extra Credit

- [ ] Storage - if your app persists data, use a tool like Parse or Firebase.
- [] If applicable, use an MVC Framework - Make your app production grade with a full-on MVC.

# Node Catapult

A boilerplate starter project that includes Node, Express, Browserify, and Mithril:

* Minimal - Understand everything.
* Efficient - Great defaults for development and production.
* Rapid - Get started immediately.

## Getting Started

```
$ git clone https://github.com/mindeavor/node-catapult my-project
$ cd my-project
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Now visit [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000/)

## Browserify Middleware

The most notable part of this app is [browserify-middleware](https://github.com/ForbesLindesay/browserify-middleware). Great node packages are exceedingly rare â€“ this is one of those packages.
